# Go Exercises

This repo contains exercises from the Go Nanodegree program.

## Setup

Use `go run main.go` to run any of the scripts.

If you encounter missing package issues, run `go get`.

## Contributing

Because this is a code-along project and the commits correspond to specific videos in the program, we will not be accepting pull requests.

If you feel like there's a major problem, please open an issue to discuss the problem and potential resolution.
